Chest x-rays are often an easy way to determine if a patient is healthy or has some form of pneumonia. Once a patient is determined to have pneumonia, the type of pneumnia they have can be further broken down into viral pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia. The novel coronavirus, as its name suggests, is a viral infection that can cause pneumonia. These cases of viral pneumonia can be broken down even further to distinguish pneumonia due to COVID from pneumonia caused by other viral infections. This project explores various deep learning models to distinguish these different types of chest x-rays to search for pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and ultimately, COVID pneumonia as a basic approach to COVID diagnosis.
